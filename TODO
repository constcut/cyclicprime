1. Geometric Progression in 2-3 numeric systems at the same time
2. Intervals from geometric progression - sonification in Midi. Not only from 14*2 +++ also N*3 pentatonics.
3. Full reptend: reversed pattern, reversed pair (group) visualistaion
4. Difference between Geometric progression '7*5' - and cyclic prime numbers from other numeric systems
5. Open multiple circles from full reptend page, to demonstrate fast
6. Visualise cyclic prime numbers connections between numeric systems
7. Explore 1/49, 1/343 and so on on the geometric progressions
8. Limit in 62 numeric systems by gmpy2, check in own way to explore cyclic prime numbers connections
